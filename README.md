## Get the project running
To get the project running you have to install all the requirements. They are all in the requirements.txt. To install it on windows you have to "cd" in the project folder and run: 
````
pip install -r requirements.txt
````
After that you can run the `app.py` in the `src` folder. This will load a while, because the databse is created (1-2 min). When finished, you will get the following output in your console:
````
